# AutoHotPie (Pie-Menus-V2)

Radial menus for Windows, designed for digital artists or macro enthusiasts, sponsored by unemployment :)

# Installation

Go to [releases](https://github.com/dumbeau/AutoHotPie/releases), download and run the installer and install it.  Currently, this is an alpha pre-release, there will be bugs so use at your own risk.


I hope putting a circle on your screen brings you as much happiness as it brings me... shut up that's not lame.

# General Usage

When you open AutoHotPie for the first time, there will be a default profile.  This profile will be active whenever an application specific profile is not focused.  There will be an initial pie menu "Newborn Pie Menu".

## Pen Tablets
In order to activate a pie menu with a pen button, go into your pen software and set a key to send '4th click / Forward' or '5th Click / Back'.  You may use any other key, but other keys may not send their 'key-up' signal when the pen button is released.
